# Task 3 - Writing Basic SELECT Queries

## üéØ Objective:
Extract data from one or more tables using SELECT queries.

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced:
- SELECT *
- SELECT specific columns
- WHERE, AND, OR conditions
- LIKE '%value%'
- BETWEEN
- ORDER BY (sorting)
- LIMIT (restrict number of rows)
- IN vs =
- DESC (descending sort)
- DISTINCT
- Aliasing (AS)

## üõ† Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench (local instance)

## üìã What I Did:
- Created a new database: `task3`
- Created a table: `Students`
- Inserted sample data into `Students`
- Wrote and executed the following types of queries:
  - Display all records
  - Filter records using WHERE, AND, OR
  - Pattern matching using LIKE
  - Filter range using BETWEEN
  - Sort results using ORDER BY (ASC & DESC)
  - Limit number of results using LIMIT
  - Select unique values using DISTINCT
  - Rename output columns using alias (AS)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:
1. Open `task3_queries.sql` in MySQL Workbench
2. Run the script (Ctrl + Shift + Enter)
3. View the data using `SELECT * FROM Students;`
